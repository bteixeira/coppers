Yopa is a simple WebApp I wrote in Django to keep track of my daily and monthly
expenditures. Far from being a complete accounting application, it simply lets
you input your spendings, and shows you a collection of stats and graphs based
on that. For example, it is useful to know not just how much you spend every
month in total, but how much you spend on gas every month, and whether that
amount is raising. It is also interesting to see in a pie chart what part of
your budget you are dedicating to phone calls, or meals, or whatever.
